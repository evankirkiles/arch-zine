      Print media is dying. As readers gravitate toward online platforms for
      their news, entertainment, and information needs, physical newspapers and
      magazines are increasingly dropping in both relevance and revenue. While
      print media once served as the cornerstone of public discourse and a
      primary source of knowledge, it now faces a multitude of challenges that
      have led to its steady decline.

      >People simply do not consume information in the same way as they once
      did. With the proliferation of smartphones and other mobile devices,
      readers now expect immediate, personalized, and interactive content that
      print publications by definition cannot provide. Digital platforms—social
      media networks and online news outlets, for two—offer a level of immediacy
      and customization that traditional print cannot match, leading to a
      significant drop in newspaper and magazine readership. According to the
      Pew Research Center, weekday newspaper circulation has decreased by over
      50% since 2008, a clear indicator of this consumer behavior shift.

      >The rise of digital advertising has also severely impacted print media's
      traditional revenue streams. Advertisers are increasingly opting for
      digital platforms that offer targeted marketing options based on user
      data, providing a higher return on investment. As a result, there have
      been significant losses in advertising revenue for both newspapers and
      magazines, which once relied heavily on classified ads and print
      campaigns. Industry consolidation has further exacerbated the issue, as
      many media companies have downsized or gone out of business entirely due
      to dwindling profits.

    <p style="margin-block-start: auto;">
      In response to these pressures, print outlets have been forced to adapt.
      Some have reduced publication frequencies or transitioned entirely to
      digital formats to cut costs and remain competitive. However, digital
      advertising revenue has not fully compensated for the loss in print
      advertising, leaving many print companies struggling to find sustainable
      business models. Social media continues to disrupt the traditional news
      distribution model, and has become the primary source of information for
      many consumers, leading to a decline in engagement with conventional
      journalism. For print media to survive, it must find new ways to engage
      with the youth.
